  My final project idea is to use data I have collected from seed germination trials of rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa), as well as data collected from field observations on pollen flow and how pollinators play a role in speciation events of rabbitbrush.
  I would like to analyze data in a few ways. I would love to have a pollen flow map of the sites I have been doing research at. Specifically showing pollen flow between plant genotypes.
  Additionally, I would like to have several box blots that show the relationship between germination trials of genotypes and its deciduousness, and a box plot showing genotype and floral traits of rabbitbrush. I think I also would like to have a plot that shows what pollinator families visit specific genotypes.
