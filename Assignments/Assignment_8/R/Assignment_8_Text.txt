1: Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
The predicted response value was linear to the real data. So it fit along with the model really well.

2: In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
I believe that Humidity would be a non-linear variable. It is only categorized by "High" or "Low". Though in the plot facet wrapped by Humidity did show a difference in the growthrate of the two species involved.

Here is the source that helped me to grasp the concept a lot better:

3: Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

dat <- read_csv("./Data/non_linear_relationship.csv")

#plotting the data without messing with it just to get an idea:
dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=response, y=predictor))+
  geom_point()
  
  
I kind of get it, but also not quite sure how to go about completing this portion of the assignment. I read about the nls function?
