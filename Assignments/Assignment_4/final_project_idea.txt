1.    "final_project_idea.txt" Created.

2.    In it, describe your idea for a data analysis final project:

My final project idea is to use data I have collected from seed germination trials of rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa), as well as data collected from field observations on pollen flow and how pollinators play a role in speciation events of rabbitbrush.

3.    Also, Describe the sort of data you will use, potential sources, and what the data might look like:

I would like to analyze data in a few ways. I would love to have a pollen flow map of the sites I have been doing research at. Specifically showing pollen flow between plant genotypes.
  Additionally, I would like to have several box blots that show the relationship between germination trials of genotypes and its deciduousness, and a box plot showing genotype and floral traits of rabbitbrush. I think I also would like to have a plot that shows what pollinator families visit specific genotypes. 
  

4.   Create fake data that simulates what your final project data set might look like:

I created a germination plot with germination data in .csv (all on my Github).

5.    Generate a plot (using ggplot) using either your real or fake data that shows at least one expected result:

Plot created. Showing the germination percent for all the sites I collected seeds from. Just to get an idea of the success of seeds in each location.
